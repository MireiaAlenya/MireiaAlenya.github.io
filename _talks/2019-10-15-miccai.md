Our strategies are derived from knowledge such as medical decision trees and inconsistencies in the annotations of multiple experts, which allows us to assign a degree of difficulty to each training sample. We demonstrate that if we start learning "easy" examples and move towards "hard", the model can reach a better performance, even with fewer data.
