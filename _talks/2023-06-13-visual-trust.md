. We presented a deep learning model based on a nnUNet for multilabel segmentation. Results from this challenge are published in Medical Image Analysis, titled "Fetal brain tissue annotation and segmentation challenge results" https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2023.102833, where we are listed as co-authors. Our 3-minute presentation can be seen here: [link](https://feta.grand-challenge.org/feta-2021/).
