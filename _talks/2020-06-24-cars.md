Our approach is derived from Curriculum Learning (CL), itself grounded on the starting small concept. Examples are presented gradually increasing the difficulty, i.e. easy examples are presented before ambiguous ones. Following this principle, in [1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-32226-7_77) authors proposed to reorder the training images based on medical knowledge to ease the training of the CNN and achieved an improved performance. Instead of reordering, in this work we propose a new deep curriculum strategy to leverage the hierarchy of the labels and improve the baseline classification performance.
