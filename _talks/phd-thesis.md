<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>This dissertation presents a novel computational pipeline for creating patient-specific models of brain development. Initially, the human brain develops from a smooth to a convoluted cortical surface, with abnormal folding patterns linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. Existing computational models, limited by their focus on synthetic or simplified anatomies, are enhanced in this work through the integration of longitudinal imaging data. Utilizing fetal brain MRIs, personalized 3D finite-element meshes were generated to simulate brain development. These simulations were then compared with neonatal images using several metrics. Applied to a cohort including controls and ventriculomegaly cases, this research also developed deep learning techniques for accelerated tissue segmentation and simulation surrogates. This approach marks the first in literature to model brain development in patient-specific geometries across multiple subjects. The findings pave the way for future advancements in realistic brain mechanical simulations, potentially aiding early detection and intervention planning for neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>
<p>The presentation of my dissertation will be <strong>soon</strong> available on [Youtube].</p>
