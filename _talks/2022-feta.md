<p>2-minute talk describing our contribution to <a href="https://feta.grand-challenge.org/Home/">FeTA Challenge 2022</a>.  </p>

<p>Our team was: Valentin Comte, Oscar Camara, Miguel Angel Gonz√°lez-Ballested, Gemma Piella and me. 
  We presented a deep learning model based on nn-UNet for multilabel segmentation, incorporating global intensity non-linear augmentation (GIN) and interventional pseudocorrelation augmentation (IPA) to generalize the results to data from other centres.  </p>
  
<p>Our contribution will also be included in a journal paper entitled "Multi-Center Fetal Brain Tissue Annotation (FeTA) Challenge 2022 Results" that is planned to be published within the next year. We achieved the 6th rank overall among 22 participating teams. </p>
