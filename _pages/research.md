My research aims at **learning feature representations** for medical image **diagnosis** facing common medical imaging data challenges. Namely **limited data, class-imbalance, noisy annotations and data privacy** for collaborative learning between different hospitals. 

I have explored the role of **architectural design** in dealing with **spatial information** for several classification tasks. Also, I have investigated easing the optimization of the deep network parameters by gradually increasing the difficulty of the training samples. This gradual increase is based on the concept of **curriculum learning** and achieved with a **data scheduler** that controls the order and pace of the samples. 

My PhD thesis was entitled **“Learning Representations for Medical Image Diagnosis: Impact of Curriculum Training and Architectural Design”**.
