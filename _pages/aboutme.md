I graduated in October 2021 with a dissertation in **learning representations for medical image diagnosis** at the **Pompeu Fabra University** (UPF). I was part of the [BCN MedTech](https://www.upf.edu/web/bcn-medtech/) group and my PhD thesis was supervised by [Gemma Piella](https://www.upf.edu/web/simbiosys/entry/-/-/37215/adscripcion/gemma-piella) and [Diana Mateus]() (Ecole Centrale Nantes). During this time, I was an [INPhINIT](https://fundacionlacaixa.org/en/inphinit-doctoral-fellowships-call) fellow funded by “La Caixa” foundation and H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie programme. Previously, during my master’s studies at the **Technical University of Munich** (TUM), I was a research assistant at the Rechts der Isar Hospital of Munich.

Though I enjoy the maths side of my research, I like getting out of the research bubble to **[disseminate](https://ameliajimenez.github.io/outreach/)** my work to the general public. In particular, I find very interesting the interaction with children. They have very curious minds. We live in a global and diverse world where **equality** is not achieved in many ways. One that worries and concerns me is the **gender gap** in scientific and technologic careers. During my time in Barcelona, it was very fulfilling to participate in several **volunteering activities**, both to reach general society, and to try to **empower** young girls to **increase diversity** in our field.

I consider work-life balance very important. In my free time, I enjoy going to the **cinema and concerts, reading and playing board games**. Probably, I spend most of my free time doing **sports**. I’m fond of team sports, I used to play handball, and I’m an occasional soccer and beach volleyball player. In recent times, I’ve discovered my passion for natural landscapes and love going to the **mountains**. I’m an active **hiker and cycler**. My passion for **music** is a bit controversial, I don’t have any musical education or experience but love all kinds of rhythms. I’ve just started to learn the box, let’s see how it goes.
