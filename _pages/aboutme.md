I graduated in October 2021 with a dissertation in **learning representations for medical image diagnosis** at the **Pompeu Fabra University**. I was part of the [BCN MedTech](https://www.upf.edu/web/bcn-medtech/) group and my PhD thesis was supervised by [Gemma Piella](https://www.upf.edu/web/simbiosys/entry/-/-/37215/adscripcion/gemma-piella) and [Diana Mateus]() (Ecole Centrale Nantes). During this time, I was an [INPhINIT](https://fundacionlacaixa.org/en/inphinit-doctoral-fellowships-call) fellow funded by “La Caixa” foundation and EU Horizon 2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie programme. I hold a degree in Telecommunications Engineering from the **University of Granada** and a Master of Science in Biomedical Computing from the **Technical University of Munich**. During my master’s studies I was a research assistant at the Rechts der Isar Hospital of Munich.

Though I enjoy the maths side of my work, I like getting out of the research bubble to **[disseminate](https://ameliajimenez.github.io/outreach/)** research to the general public. Dissemination is also an opportunity to break with **gender stereotypes**, give **visibility to diverse role models** and **empower** young girls to pursue scientific and technologic careers. With this aim I have contributed, with my two cents, in several **volunteering activities**.

In my free time, I enjoy going to the **cinema and concerts, reading, cooking and playing board games**. I probably spend most of my free time **traveling** and doing **[sports](https://www.strava.com/athletes/80615838)**. I’m fond of team sports: handball, soccer, beach volleyball, etc. I love being surrounded by nature, I enjoy going to the **mountains** and just staring at natural landscapes. I’m an active **hiker and cycler**. My passion for **music** is a bit controversial, I don’t have any musical education but love all kinds of rhythms. I’ve just started to learn the box, let’s see how it goes.
