Hi, I am **Amelia**. I recently completed my Ph.D. at **Pompeu Fabra University**. I was a member of the [BCN MedTech group](https://www.upf.edu/web/bcn-medtech/). My research has been supervised by [Gemma Piella](https://www.upf.edu/web/simbiosys/entry/-/-/37215/adscripcion/gemma-piella) and [Diana Mateus](https://www.ls2n.fr/annuaire/Diana%20MATEUS/). My research aims at **learning representations** for **medical image diagnosis** facing common medical imaging **data challenges**, namely limited data, class-imbalance, noisy annotations and data privacy. I hold a degree in Telecommunications Engineering from the **University of Granada** and a Master of Science in Biomedical Computing from the **Technical University of Munich**.

In my thesis, we investigated **two key aspects** to learn **feature representations** leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks from medical images for Computer-Aided Diagnosis tasks. First, we explored the role of **architectural design** in dealing with spatial information. Second, we designed **curriculum training** strategies to control the order, pace, and number of images presented to the optimizer.

My dissertation is entitled **"Learning Representations for Medical Image Diagnosis: Impact of Curriculum Training and Architectural Design"**. You can both [**watch**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvlRW6g_7Co&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=AmeliaJim%C3%A9nezS%C3%A1nchez) it or [**download**](https://www.upf.edu/documents/227877672/228393595/thesis.pdf/fdc68a9d-012b-f513-1455-a6c93d4903b5) it.
