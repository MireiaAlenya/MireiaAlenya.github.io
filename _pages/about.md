Hi, I am **Mireia**. Welcome to my webpage!

I am a doctoral researcher studying fetal brain development during gestation using finite element methods modeling and deep learning algorithms for image segmentation and accelerating models' simulations.

This website contains some personal and professional information about me.

<tr><td> Feb. 2024: </td> <td> I have successfully defended my PhD thesis "Computational analysis of fetal brain development with patient-specific modelling and deep learning techniques".
</td></tr> 
<tr><td> July 2023: </td> <td> Our work "A deep learning approach for modelling fetal brain development" has been presented in the session on Fetal Modelling of the BCN-MedTech seminars.
</td></tr> 
<tr><td> Dec 2022: </td> <td> I'm thrilled to announce I have just landed to Auckand, New Zealand, for a 4-month research stay at the Auckland Bioengineering Institute. I'm about to learn from Gonzalo Maso and his team to develop a deep-learning surrogate model able to accelerate FEM simulations of brain growth and folding.
