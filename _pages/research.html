<!---<h2>Images Side by Side</h2>--->
<!---<p>How to create side-by-side images with the CSS float property:</p>--->

<p> My PhD research has aimed at <b>gaining insights into how fetal brain development occurs</b>, using image processing and analysis, computational modeling, and deep learning techniques. I have been a member of the <a href="https://www.neuron-eranet.eu/projects/MULTI-FACT/">MULTI-FACT EraNeuron Project</a>, which aims to provide the scientific community with an open-access multi-centric pipeline for fetal processing data (current version: <a href="https://github.com/fetpype/fetpype/tree/main">fetpype</a>).</p> 

<p> I first defined a complete 3D computational pipeline to build and validate patient-specific mechanical models of brain development. Starting from the processing of fetal brain magnetic resonance images (MRI), personalized finite-element 3D meshes were generated, in which biomechanical models were run to simulate brain development. Several metrics were then employed to compare simulation results with neonatal images from the same subjects, on a common reference space. We applied the computational pipeline to a cohort of 29 subjects where fetal and neonatal MRI were available, including controls and ventriculomegaly cases.<p> 
<p> I participated in two FeTA Challenges hosted within the MICCAI conference. During the first challenge, the goal was to create a deep learning algorithm capable of accurately segmenting tissues within the fetal brain using data from a single center. 
  This involved considering various factors such as different gestational ages (GA), conditions (normal/abnormal), various superresolution reconstruction algorithms, and MRI quality. 
  In the second challenge, the objective shifted to developing domain generalization algorithms. These algorithms aimed to create robust solutions capable of addressing the domain gap observed when using multicentric data. 
  Participants were provided with cases from two distinct centers, and their algorithms were rigorously tested against datasets from these centers as well as from two additional centers not included during training. </p>
  
<p>In the last stage of my PhD, I did a research stay at the Auckland Bioengineering Institute, to collaborate with Gonzalo Maso-Talou to accelerate FEM simulations using a deep-learning-based surrogate model.</p>

<h2> Teaching </h2>
<li> 2019-2023: Introducció a la Universitat i a l’Enginyeria Biomèdica. Two theoretical classes (4 hours each year) that focus on the presentation of Matlab software, as well as the basics of computer science and programming; Five practical sessions (20 hours each year) dedicated to programming with Matlab, and three (12 hours each year) sessions are focused on mesh processing and 3D printing using different software.</li>
<li> 2019-2022: Modeling of Organs and Systems. Five seminars (10 hours each year) based on learning how to use AutoCAD, ANSYS, and Paraview, heart mesh processing with Meshmixer, and fundamentals of how mesh data is structured in files of different formats. </li>
  
<h2> Students </h2>
<li> 2021-2022: Francesc Carandell - Towards the use of meshless methods to simulate brain growth in early development (Bachelor Thesis). He worked on setting the first steps to model cortical folding through meshless methods, using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) </li>
<li> 2020-2021: Maria Inmaculada Villanueva - Segmentation and morphological analysis of fetal and neonatal brains in normal and abnormal infants (Master Thesis).
