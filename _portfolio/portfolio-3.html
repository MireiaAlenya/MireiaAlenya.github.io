<p> FeTA Challenge 2021: We presented a deep learning model based on a nnUNet for multilabel segmentation. </p>
<p> FeTA Challenge 2022: held in Singapore on September 18th. Our team presented a deep learning model based on nn-UNet for multilabel segmentation, incorporating global intensity non-linear augmentation (GIN) and interventional pseudocorrelation augmentation (IPA) to generalize the results to data from other centres. Our contribution will also be included in a journal paper that is planned to be published within the next year. We achieved the 6th rank overall among 22 participating teams.</p>

#<p>Proximal femur fractures are a significant problem especially of the elderly population in the western world. Starting at an <strong>age of 65</strong> the <strong>incidence</strong> of femoral fractures <strong>increases exponentially</strong> and is <strong>almost doubled every five years</strong>. The consequences of proximal femur fractures have a significant socioeconomic impact since the <strong>mortality rate one year after the accident</strong> ranges between <strong>14 and 36%</strong>. In almost all cases, <strong>surgical treatment</strong> has to be considered the <strong>gold standard</strong>. If surgical treatment is decelerated, several complications, as well as an increase in mortality rates, may result. <strong>Early detection and classification of proximal femur fractures are crucial for the indication of surgery</strong> and, if so, to choose the adequate surgical implant. In this context, the <strong>Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen (AO-Foundation)</strong> established a generally applicable and valid <strong>classification system for fractures of all bones</strong> of the skeleton based on <strong>X-rays</strong> including the proximal femurs.</p>
#<p>We aim to <strong>develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tool</strong> based on <strong>radiographs</strong> to automatically <strong>identify</strong> proximal femur fractures in a first step, <strong>and</strong> consecutively <strong>classify</strong> them <strong>according to the AO standard</strong>. Such a CAD system can not only help in the correct classification of fractures but also be effective in <strong>planning the optimal therapy</strong> for the individual patient since the <strong>adequate treatment plan</strong> arises from the initial classification.</p>
