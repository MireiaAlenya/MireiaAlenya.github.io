<p>Currently, numerous state of the art solutions for medical image analysis tasks such as computer-aided detection or diagnosis rely on <strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</strong>. The popularity of CNNs relies on their capability to <strong>learn meaningful and hierarchical image representations</strong> directly from examples, resulting in a feature extraction approach that is flexible, general and capable of encoding complex patterns.
</p>

<p>CNNs <strong>requirement for big amounts of data</strong> is commonly justified by a large number of network parameters to train under a non-convex optimization scheme. We argue, however, that part of these data requirements is there to cope with their <strong>poor modeling of spatial invariance</strong>. As it is known, purely convolutional networks are not natively spatially invariant. Instead, they <strong>rely on pooling layers to achieve translation invariance</strong>, and on <strong>data-augmentation to handle rotation invariance</strong>. With pooling, the convolution filters learn the distinctive features of the object of interest irrespective of their location. Thereby <strong>losing the spatial relationship among features</strong> which might be essential to determine their class (e.g. the presence of plane parts in an image does not ensure that it contains a plane).
</p>

<p><strong>Capsule Networks</strong> were introduced as an alternative deep learning architecture and training approach <strong>to model the spatial/viewpoint variability of an object in the image</strong>. Inspired by computer graphics, capsule networks not only learn good weights for feature extraction and image classification but also <strong>learn how to infer pose parameters</strong> from the image. Poses are modeled as multidimensional vectors whose entries parametrize spatial variations such as rotation, thickness, skewness, etc. As an example, a capsule network learns to determine whether a plane is in the image, but also if the plane is located to the left or right or if it is rotated. This is known as <strong><em>equivariance</em></strong> and it is a property of human one-shot learning type of vision.
