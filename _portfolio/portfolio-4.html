<p> Machine learning has shown promising results in medical image diagnosis, at times with claims of expert-level performance. The availability of large public datasets have shifted the interest of the medical community to high-performance algorithms. However, <strong>little attention is paid to the quality of the data or annotations</strong>. Algorithms with high reported performances have been shown to suffer from <strong>overfitting or shortcuts, i.e. spurious correlations between artifacts in images and diagnostic labels</strong>. Examples include pen marks in skin lesion classification, patient position in detection of COVID-19, and chest drains in pneumothorax classification. Performance may appear high when training and evaluating on data with shortcuts, but degraded when the shortcut is removed. This happens because <strong>the algorithm cannot generalize based on the actual features related to the diagnosis</strong>.
</p>
<p> Our goal is to <strong>redefine how meta-data is used</strong> and thus improve the robustness of algorithms. We plan to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li> investigate what kind of different shortcuts (based on demographics or image artefacts) might occur and how these affect the performance and fairness of the algorithms ‚öñÔ∏è. </li>
    <li> investigate meta-data-aware methods to try to avoid learning biases or shortcuts ‚öîÔ∏èüõ°.</li>
</ul>
