<p> In this work we present a complete computational pipeline to build and validate patient-specific mechanical models of brain development. Starting from the processing of fetal brain magnetic resonance images (MRI), personalised finite-element 3D meshes were generated, in which biomechanical models were run to simulate brain development. </p>
<p>  Several metrics were then employed to compare simulation results with neonatal images from the same subjects, on a common reference space. We applied the computational pipeline to a cohort of 29 subjects where fetal and neonatal MRI were available, including controls and ventriculomegaly cases.  </p>
<p> In process </p>
