Proximal femur fractures are a significant problem especially of the elderly population in the western world. Starting at an **age of 65** the **incidence** of femoral fractures **increases exponentially** and is **almost doubled every five years**. The consequences of proximal femur fractures have a significant socioeconomic impact since the **mortality rate one year after the accident** ranges between **14 and 36\%**. In almost all cases, **surgical treatment** has to be considered the **gold standard**. If surgical treatment is decelerated, several complications, as well as an increase in mortality rates, may result. **Early detection and classification of proximal femur fractures are crucial for the indication of surgery** and, if so, to choose the adequate surgical implant. In this context, the **Arbeitsgemeinschaft f√ºr Osteosynthesefragen (AO-Foundation)** established a generally applicable and valid **classification system for fractures of all bones** of the skeleton based on **X-rays** including the proximal femurs.

We aim to **develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tool** based on **radiographs** to automatically **identify** proximal femur fractures in a first step, **and** consecutively **classify** them **according to the AO standard**. Such a CAD system can not only help in the correct classification of fractures but also be effective in **planning the optimal therapy** for the individual patient since the **adequate treatment plan** arises from the initial classification.
